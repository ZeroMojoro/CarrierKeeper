# Version Change Log

## V1 - Release Candidate C

- Changed parametric model to parameterize the heights of the BCG cutout and the smaller bolt cutout. Done to enable quick change of model for supporting sizing variations for AR-15 bolt, Conversion 556 bolt and Conversion 22 bolts

- Added dedicated STL outputs for sizing variants

- Add a half millimeter of internal spacing tollerance

## V1 - Release Candidate B

- Added additional parametric model outputs

## V1 - Release Candidate A

- Initial version with just Conversion 556 version of the Keeper component. This variation was able to fit all flavors of supported bolts (at the expense of some wasted space/filament)
